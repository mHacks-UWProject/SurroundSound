SurroundSound
=============

Music Interest Project

##What does this even do?

Its all kinds of nifty. 

Here's how it works:

1. The web portion is a website that allows users to host a 'sound lounge' and select a radius from that location.
2. Then, phones with the SurroundSound Android app that connect to that 'sound lounge' automatically upload all of their music library (names, not files) to the server.
3. Then the server churns out a playlist based on what genres people around seem to like
4. And then the host computer plays the music
5. All the while, the Android app has a list of the current playing song and a list of the next upcoming songs, and has the ability to upvote/downvote songs
6. And the server automatically removes or bumps songs based on votes!

Neato.
